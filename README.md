# Cerebral Palsy VR Therapy: A Gaming Approach

### Project Overview

**Cerebral Palsy VR Therapy: A Gaming Approach** is a Unity-based Virtual Reality game designed to facilitate physical rehabilitation for Cerebral Palsy patients. The game creates an immersive virtual environment where patients, especially children, can perform therapeutic exercises in a fun, engaging, and interactive way. This project aims to make physical therapy more enjoyable and effective for individuals with Cerebral Palsy by using gaming techniques to enhance motivation and involvement.

### Key Features
- **Therapeutic Gaming**: The game integrates rehabilitation exercises into gameplay, allowing users to improve their motor skills while enjoying an interactive experience.
- **Virtual Reality (VR) Experience**: Leveraging the immersive capabilities of VR, the game engages the patient fully, increasing focus and engagement.
- **Customizable Levels**: The difficulty of the exercises can be adjusted based on the patient’s needs and progression.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The system provides immediate feedback, enabling patients and therapists to track progress and adapt exercises as needed.
- **Toy Store Environment for Children**: The game features a virtual toy store designed specifically for children with Cerebral Palsy. Children can explore the store, shop for toys, and play with them in a virtual environment. Each movement in the game corresponds to therapeutic exercises, making the experience less monotonous and more enjoyable for children.

### Toy Store Feature
- **Child-Friendly Design**: The virtual toy store environment was created based on research into how children with Cerebral Palsy engage with therapy. Children love toys, and this setting helps ease the stress associated with physical therapy.
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Children move around the store, shop for toys, and play with them. Each action they perform, whether reaching for toys or walking in the store, corresponds to therapeutic movements that help with their daily exercises.
- **Increased Engagement**: The playful environment encourages children to spend more time in therapy, which improves the effectiveness of the exercises compared to traditional, monotonous routines.

### Technologies Used
1. **Unity**: The core game engine used to develop the VR environment and gameplay mechanics.
2. **C#**: Primary programming language for game logic and interaction.
3. **ShaderLab**: Used to create custom shaders for visual effects in the game.
4. **Objective-C++**: For interfacing VR hardware with the game software.
5. **Virtual Reality SDKs**: Used for integrating VR hardware such as Oculus Rift or HTC Vive into the gaming experience.

### Tools & Libraries
- **Unity**: For building and designing the virtual environment and gameplay mechanics.
- **C#**: For scripting game behavior, interactions, and user interface.
- **Objective-C++**: For managing integration between VR hardware and Unity.
- **ShaderLab**: For adding visual enhancements and effects to the game environment.
- **VR SDKs and Google SDK**: Oculus/SteamVR for interfacing with VR headsets and controllers.

### Game Features
- **Physical Exercises**: Players engage in a variety of physical activities such as reaching, balancing, and movement, aimed at improving motor function.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Patients can play in a virtual world where they collect items, reach targets, and solve puzzles as part of their therapy.
- **Toy Store Environment**: Children can explore the toy store, shop for toys, and play with them. The fun environment encourages longer playtime, translating to more effective therapy sessions.
- **Progress Tracking**: Therapists can monitor the player’s progress and adjust the difficulty as needed based on the performance in the game.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
2. Open the project in **Unity** (version 2020.3 or later).
3. Set up VR hardware (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive) and ensure the necessary drivers and SDKs are installed.
4. Build the project for your platform (Windows/Mac) by navigating to:
   ```
   File > Build Settings
   ```
5. Select the appropriate VR settings for your hardware and build the project.

### Usage
1. Launch the VR game.
2. Equip the VR headset and follow the on-screen prompts to start the therapy session.
3. Use the VR controllers to interact with the virtual world and complete therapy tasks.
4. Progress through various levels and exercises, and track performance via the in-game feedback system.
5. For children, navigate through the toy store, explore and shop for toys while performing therapeutic movements.
